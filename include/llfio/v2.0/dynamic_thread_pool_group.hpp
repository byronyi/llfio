/*! \class dynamic_thread_pool_group
\brief Work group within the global dynamic thread pool.

Some operating systems provide a per-process global kernel thread pool capable of
dynamically adjusting its kernel thread count to how many of the threads in
the pool are currently blocked. The platform will choose the exact strategy used,
but as an example of a strategy, one might keep creating new kernel threads
so long as the total threads currently running and not blocked on page faults,
i/o or syscalls, is below the hardware concurrency. Similarly, if more threads
are running and not blocked than hardware concurrency, one might remove kernel
threads from executing work. Such a strategy would dynamically increase
concurrency until all CPUs are busy, but reduce concurrency if more work is
being done than CPUs available.

Such dynamic kernel thread pools are excellent for CPU bound processing, you
simply fire and forget work into them. However, for i/o bound processing, you
must be careful as there are gotchas. For non-seekable i/o, it is very possible
that there could be 100k handles upon which we do i/o. Doing i/o on
100k handles using a dynamic thread pool would in theory cause the creation
of 100k kernel threads, which would not be wise. A much better solution is
to use an `io_multiplexer` to await changes in large sets of i/o handles.

For seekable i/o, the same problem applies, but worse again: an i/o bound problem
would cause a rapid increase in the number of kernel threads, which by
definition makes i/o even more congested. Basically the system runs off
into pathological performance loss. You must therefore never naively do
i/o bound work (e.g. with memory mapped files) from within a dynamic thread
pool without employing some mechanism to force concurrency downwards if
the backing storage is congested.

## Work groups

Instances of this class contain zero or more work items. Each work item
is asked for its next item of work, and if an item of work is available,
that item of work is executed by the global kernel thread pool at a time
of its choosing. It is NEVER possible that any one work item is concurrently
executed at a time, each work item is always sequentially executed with
respect to itself. The only concurrency possible is *across* work items.
Therefore, if you want to execute the same piece of code concurrently,
you need to submit a separate work item for each possible amount of
concurrency (e.g. `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`).

You can have as many or as few items of work as you like. You can
dynamically submit additional work items at any time, except when a group
is currently in the process of being stopped. The group of work items can
be waited upon to complete, after which the work group becomes reset as
if back to freshly constructed. You can also stop executing all the work
items in the group, even if they have not fully completed. If any work
item returns a failure, this equals a `stop()`, and the next `wait()` will
return that error.

Work items may create sub work groups as part of their
operation. If they do so, the work items from such nested work groups are
scheduled preferentially. This ensures good forward progress, so if you
have 100 work items each of which do another 100 work items, you don't get
10,000 slowly progressing work. Rather, the work items in the first set
progress slowly, whereas the work items in the second set progress quickly.

`work_item::next()` may optionally set a deadline to delay when that work
item ought to be processed again. Deadlines can be relative or absolute.

## C++ 23 Executors

As with elsewhere in LLFIO, as a low level facility, we don't implement
https://wg21.link/P0443 Executors, but it is trivially easy to implement
a dynamic equivalent to `std::static_thread_pool` using this class.

## Implementation notes

### Microsoft Windows

On Microsoft Windows, the Win32 thread pool API is used (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/thread-pool-api).
This is an IOCP-aware thread pool which will dynamically increase the number
of kernel threads until none are blocked. If more kernel threads
are running than twice the number of CPUs in the system, the number of kernel
threads is dynamically reduced. The maximum number of kernel threads which
will run simultaneously is 500. Note that the Win32 thread pool is shared
across the process by multiple Windows facilities.

Note that the Win32 thread pool has built in support for IOCP, so if you
have a custom i/o multiplexer, you can use the global Win32 thread pool
to execute i/o completions handling. See `CreateThreadpoolIo()` for more.

No dynamic memory allocation is performed by this implementation outside
of the initial `make_dynamic_thread_pool_group()`. The Win32 thread pool
API may perform dynamic memory allocation internally, but that is outside
our control.

### POSIX

If an installation of libdispatch is detected by LLFIO cmake during
configuration, it is used preferentially. libdispatch is better known as
Grand Central Dispatch, originally a Mac OS technology but since ported
to a high quality kernel based implementation on recent FreeBSDs, and to
a lower quality userspace based implementation on Linux. Generally
libdispatch should get automatically found on Mac OS without additional
effort; on FreeBSD it may need installing from ports; on Linux you would
need to explicitly install `libdispatch-dev` or the equivalent. You can
disable the automatic discovery in cmake of libdispatch by setting the
cmake variable `LLFIO_DISABLE_LIBDISPATCH` to On.

### Linux

If libdispatch is not found, we have a custom Linux only userspace
implementation. A a similar strategy to Microsoft Windows' approach is used. We
dynamically increase the number of kernel threads until none are sleeping
awaiting i/o. If more kernel threads are running than 1.5x the number of
CPUs in the system, the number of kernel threads is dynamically reduced.
For portability, we also gate the maximum number of kernel threads to 500,
except where threads have been detected as being in prolonged wait states.
Note that **all** the kernel threads for the current process are considered,
not just the kernel threads created by this thread pool implementation.
Therefore, if you have alternative thread pool implementations (e.g. OpenMP,
`std::async`), those are also included in the dynamic adjustment.

As this is wholly implemented by this library, dynamic memory allocation
occurs in the initial `make_dynamic_thread_pool_group()` and per thread
creation, but otherwise the implementation does not perform dynamic memory
allocations.

  /*! \class io_aware_work_item
  \brief A work item which paces when it next executes according to i/o congestion.

  Currently there is only a working implementation of this for the Microsoft Windows
  and Linux platforms, due to lack of working `statfs_t::f_iosinprogress` on other
  platforms. If retrieving that for a seekable handle does not work, the constructor
  throws an exception.

  For seekable handles, currently `reads`, `writes` and `barriers` are ignored. We
  simply retrieve, periodically, `statfs_t::f_iosinprogress` and `statfs_t::f_iosbusytime`
  for the storage devices backing the seekable handle. If the recent averaged i/o wait time exceeds
  95% and the i/o in progress > 32, `next()` will start setting the default deadline passed to
  `io_aware_next()`. Thereafter, every 1/10th of a second, if `statfs_t::f_iosinprogress`
  is above 32, it will increase the deadline by 1/16th, whereas if it is
  below 32, it will decrease the deadline by 1/16th. The default deadline chosen is always the worst of all the
  storage devices of all the handles. This will reduce concurrency within the kernel thread pool
  in order to reduce congestion on the storage devices. If at any point `statfs_t::f_iosbusytime`
  drops below 95% as averaged across one second, and `statfs_t::f_iosinprogress` drops
  below 4, the additional
  throttling is completely removed. `io_aware_next()` can ignore the default deadline
  passed into it, and can set any other deadline.

  For non-seekable handles, the handle must have an i/o multiplexer set upon it, and on
  Microsoft Windows, that i/o multiplexer must be utilising the IOCP instance of the
  global Win32 thread pool. For each `reads`, `writes` and `barriers` which is non-zero,
  a corresponding zero length i/o is constructed and initiated. When the i/o completes,
  and all readable handles in the work item's set have data waiting to be read, and all
  writable handles in the work item's set have space to allow writes, only then is the
  work item invoked with the next piece of work.

  \note Non-seekable handle support is not implemented yet.
